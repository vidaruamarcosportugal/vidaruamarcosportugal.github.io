> ##### Roy Hargrove - Art Rock Festival 2010


##### _last update: Feb. 2020_

#### During the week:
- **[Bandcamp Weekly](https://bandcamp.com/?show=352)**: kind of a radioshow that highlihts every week the hottest release on the platform. Each episode showcase an artist (_and usually a cool artwok_). I really enjoy Bandcamp, their business model is fair, they work remotely and everything they do is neat. I should definitely buy more music on this platform (_I tried to set a goal last year of 1 every month at least: I failed, but I'll try again this year!_).
- I've been an active Spotify user for the past 3 years. It all started with my Dad, thriving with his ipad to find, gather and organize music. Then I found their family plan (yes we still live together of course ;) ) and decided to offer it to him, my Sister and M. I'm still confused about Spotify: it's convenient, but their business model is not good and it really makes you _consume_ music. We recently agreed with M that our music memory was bad since we use it. I kind of miss the time where I meticulously organised music in folders of my computer, with manual hard-drive backup.

#### During the week-end:
- **[Mailtape](https://www.mailta.pe/)**: I won't be objective here as it's the labor of love of a very good friend, but honestly the project is beautiful. Each sunday morning, you'll receive a music selection curated with a guest. It widens the horizon.
- **Tiny Desk Concert**: it's cool to discover or see groups you already like doing a small, non-conventional concert. This one with [BBNG ](https://www.npr.org/2017/01/19/510575120/badbadnotgood-tiny-desk-concert) is definitely one of favorite so far.

_I'll update the list along the way!_
