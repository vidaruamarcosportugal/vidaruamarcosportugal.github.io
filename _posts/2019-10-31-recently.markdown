I started this blog with jekyll and minima theme that I twisted a bit. It's been fun, I'll continue to make some small design changes along the way. 

Matthew Halsall released a new album that I purchased on [bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/), it's splendid:

This [Radiohead documentary](https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/082766-000-A/le-monde-selon-radiohead/) brought me a lot of context I didn't have about the group, and, what a group...

3 weeks ago we started portuguese classes. I'll do a post on the approach we took to learn this new language. It feels good to learn a whole new universe!

I took a paid subscription to the french online journal ['Les Jours'](https://lesjours.fr/).
It's independant, add free and high quality journalism. 
_(And they have great music recommendations --> [Four tet](https://lesjours.fr/obsessions/face-a-face-b/ep11-four-tet-charanjit-singh/) and [Nihls Frahm](https://lesjours.fr/obsessions/face-a-face-b/ep22-nils-frahm-francesco-tristano/))_

Nights are not always quiet recently, I'm happy to have this new internet tool to reflect upon.
