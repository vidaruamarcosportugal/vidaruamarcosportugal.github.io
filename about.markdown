I'm Julien.

I've recently left Paris for Lisboa with my life partner M and we're gonna be parents in a few months.

Those two changes brought an immeasurable amount of stuff in my head and I decided to create a space over the internet to unload it. 

My aim is to share thoughts, photos _(weekly?)_, to record knowledge _(through peripherical-brain posts)_ but most importantly to step back from the pace of life, reflect upon it _(through "recentlyâ€œ posts)_ and bring back some human feelings around the internet - at least for me.
