I'm Julien.

I've recently left Paris for Lisboa with my life partner M and we're gonna be parents in a few months.

Those two changes brought an immeasurable amount of stuff in my head and I decided to create a space over the internet to unload it. 

My aim is to share thoughts, photos, record cool stuff I learned _(→ "peripherical-brain" posts)_ but most importantly to step back from the pace of life, reflect upon it _(→ "recently“ posts)_ and bring back some human feelings around the internet - at least for me.

I share other contents [here and there](https://twitter.com/julienzanni).
